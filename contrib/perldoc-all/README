This stuff is about making Texinfo out of the standard Perl *.pod files.
The results used to be at http://www.gnu.org/software/perl/manual.

The idea is to unpack the perl distribution here, as in,
  wget http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/perl-5.NN.M.tar.gz  # with right NN.M
  tar xf perl-*.tar.gz
It is possible to build Perl next to have automatically generated Pod
files created.  Then run (GNU) make.  Aside from the result hopefully
being useful in itself (just copy the .info file to an Info directory),
it also serves as a nontrivial example of using pod2texi.

Note that a main issue with the generated files is that many internal
links are missing because of the Pod::Simple::Role::XHTML::WithExtraTargets
role of the MetaCPAN::Pod::XHTML class, which adds anchors:
   "Link targets based on the first word of headings will be added to make linking easier."
