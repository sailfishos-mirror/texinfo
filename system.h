/* MS-DOS and similar non-Posix systems have some peculiarities:
    - they distinguish between binary and text files;
    - they use both `/' and `\\' as directory separator in file names;
    - they can have a drive letter X: prepended to a file name;
    - they have a separate root directory on each drive;
    - their filesystems are case-insensitive;
    - directories in environment variables (like INFOPATH) are separated
        by `;' rather than `:';
    - text files can have their lines ended either with \n or with \r\n pairs;
   These are all parameterized here except the last, which is
   handled by the source code as appropriate (mostly, in info/).  */
