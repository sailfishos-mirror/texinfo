# The first column holds type names, second column contains flags.
# Flags for text elements:
#  text: distinguishes text from other elements
#  leading_space: text elements with spaces appearing before actual text.
#                 To keep in sync with Perl parser %leading_space_types.
#
# The following flags correspond to elements holding information on the tree
# associated to the type.  The association is set in the parsing
# code based on the command/container, not using these flags.  Therefore
# the type flags should be determined by looking at the parser code.  The
# main use of these flags is to determine the number of slots needed in
# the elt_info array in generated code.  These flags are not used in the
# C code.
#  spaces_before: element containing the spaces appearing before the
#                 argument
#  braces: element containing the spaces appearing between the @-command name
#          and the opening brace
#  spaces_after: element containing the spaces appearing after the argument
#
# Other flags:
#  with_command: type corresponding to @-command with name determined dynamically.
#                Index commands (that can be added with defindex, for
#                example), definfoenclose'd commands, user-defined macro calls.
#                Mainly used in C specific code for memory management and when
#                passing to Perl.
#  c_only: element type associated to @-commands appearing only in C, needed
#          because each correspond to a different need for associated info
#          element or strings.  Flag only used to avoid passing to Perl.
