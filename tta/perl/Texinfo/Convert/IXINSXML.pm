# This modules combines the Texinfo::Convert::IXIN module which
# outputs the IXIN format and the Texinfo::Convert::TexinfoSXML
# Texinfo tree converter, which converts Texinfo, and is called
# from Texinfo::Convert::IXIN, to obtain a functional IXIN format
# conversion implementation that can be called as a Texinfo converter.
# See comments at the beginning of IXIN.pm for more information.
