# This module has an implementation as XS extension:
# ALTIMP XSTexinfo/reader_element/TreeElement.xs
# In C, the tree element structure fields are accessed directly, there are
# no equivalent functions.

# The new() method of this module should be used for each creation
# of a Texinfo tree element.

# Except for the new() method, nothing in texi2any uses this module, because
# calling accessors instead of accessing hash keys is much slower in Perl, and
# also because using the XS interface requires careful code and many
# functions replacements.  The SWIG interface should be used instead.

=head1 NAME

Texinfo::TreeElement - Texinfo tree element interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $element = Texinfo::TreeElement::new({});

=head1 NOTES

The Texinfo Perl module main purpose is to be used in C<texi2any> to convert
Texinfo to other formats.  There is no promise of API stability.

Note that this module could be removed at any time.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Texinfo::TreeElement::new> should be called on every Perl tree
elements created.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item $element = new($element_hash)
X<C<new>>

Turns the I<$element_hash> element hash into a C<Texinfo::TreeElement> object.

This function is called on all the tree elements created in Texinfo modules
codes.  The call to C<new> is mainly cosmetic, to mark where a new element is
created.  It also allows to distinguish a Texinfo tree element from a hash.
