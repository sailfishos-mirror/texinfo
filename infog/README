Must have GTK 3 development files installed and libwebkit2gtk-4.0.

Run ./autogen.sh after git checkout.

Then configure and make.

Set INFO_HTML_DIR to the directory containing the documentation files.
Each manual is in its own directory, named with the name of the manual.
For links to work, cross-references should link to manuals installed
locally, not to manuals published on the World Wide Web.

texi2any --html --no-number-sections -c HTMLXREF_MODE=none ../../../hello.texi

Notes on architecture -

When a link is clicked, external links are blocked by 
main.c:decide_policy_cb.  file: links are intercepted in 
extension.c:request_callback.

If it's a link to a different manual, load_manual is called.
This in turn informs the main process that a new manual has been loaded 
via the socket, with a "new-manual" message.

A "new-node" message is also sent to say the node has changed.

The main thread should then do a ?top-node request in the hidden web 
view.  The top-node request should pass back a list of index nodes.

Then each of those should be used to give an index node to load.
