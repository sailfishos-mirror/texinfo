only 109 secondary weights although values go up to 0x127 so not possible
to simply take LSB.


* remove useless debugging/progress statements

* discontiguous matching - check if this is really necessary

* check integer alignment and endianness in dump

* put allkeys.txt version (and other metadata?) in output

* test more sequences other than l· (what are they??)

* Add gnulib vars in Makefile.am

* To avoid zero bytes, change 00 to 01 when creating binary dump.
(See TR#10 s.9.5.  This advice doesn't really make any sense as
it doesn't work for 16 bit values greater than FEOO, i.e. what
can be represented in base 255 with two digits.)

* Read Implicit weights from allkeys.txt
 
* Unicode normalisation issues.  We should extend the data table
to include "canonically decomposable characters".  (See TR#10 s.9.5.)
(It's possible the table ("DUCET") already contains these.)
Or we should do the opposite and take these out of the table to
save space!
